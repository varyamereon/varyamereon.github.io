<b>We hope</b> you like what we've done with the place! Pilot Friendly is joining Spree Forty Three, and if you'll indulge me, here are a few reasons why...

#### A short history
 Pilot Friendly has been around since 2015, a time when Windows Phone was still a thing and UWP was the next big thing for Microsoft. At the same time, EASA FTLs were being introduced in the aviation sector, and as an avid Windows Phone user I saw a gap in the market, and developed our first app, EASA FTL Calculator. Next came along Flight Deck Weather, which continues to be a very popular aviation weather app in the Microsoft Store.

#### Android and iOS join the party
After initial success, it became clear that it was not sustainable to develop these apps for Windows only, as the phone operating system was slowly dying out. So we created a new version of EASA FTL Calculator that runs on Android and iOS.

#### Spree Forty Three is born
With Windows Phone no longer being an option for me, I switched over to Android and went all in with phone and an Android Wear watch. As an LGBT developer, it became apparent that there was no good LGBT watch face for Android, and went ahead developing one myself. As this didn't fit into the Pilot Friendly brand, Spree Forty Three was born to encompass my other app projects.

#### So why merge the brands?
Running two brands means twice the work! Well not quite, but it certainly does make certain things more complicated. So I made the decision to move all my app projects over to the Spree Forty Three brand, where they will continue to develop and grow along with other ideas I have in mind. For those of you who have supported my projects over the last four year, I thank you and hope you will continue to enjoy my work in the future!
